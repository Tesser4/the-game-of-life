# The Game of Life

## Algorithm
If any **live** cell has
* **fewer than 2 live neighbors** then the cell **dies** (under-population)
* **2 or 3 live neighbors** then the cell **lives**
* **more than 3 live neighbors** then the cell **dies** (overcrowding)

If any **dead** cell haskjhkjhjk
* **exactly three live neighbors** then the cell **becomes a live cell** (reproduction)

Note: Neighbors are considered also diagonal cells (one cell has 8 neighbors)
